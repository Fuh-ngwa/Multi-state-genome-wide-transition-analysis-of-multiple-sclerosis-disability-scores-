## Abstract

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the leading causes of neurological disability in
young adults. MS disability progression is characterised by continuous-time multi-state
stochastic processes typified by heterogeneous transitions on the expanded disability
status scale (EDSS). This heterogeneity presents a major statistical challenge for
identifying genetic loci associated with disability accumulation over time. To overcome
this challenge, we assembled a cohort of deeply phenotyped individuals with MS. We
analysed prospectively ascertained, clinically confirmed disability states derived from
EDSS scores. First, we combined multiple hypothesis testing and agnostic machine
learning to identify genetic variants having meaningful associations with smooth
transition times. Next, we used a time-homogenous continuous-time multi-state
(stochastic) transition model to assess the instantaneous risk to transition between
disability states.
